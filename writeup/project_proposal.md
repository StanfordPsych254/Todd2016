###Short justification for my choice of experiment in terms of my research interests or research program

This experiment tests implicit cognitive biases that come from the stereotype associating Black men with violence and criminality. My research interest also lies in stereotype and discrimination and ultimately on how best to combat these biases. I'm hoping that by learning this experimental procedure (e.g. weapon identification task), I can extend it to do research about other stigmatized groups.

Pervasive stereotypes linking Black men with violence and criminality can lead to implicit cognitive biases, including the misidentification of harmless objects as weapons. 
A short justification for your choice of experiment in terms of your research interests or research program (1 paragraph). This justification should tell us why you chose this particular result.

### Description of the stimuli and procedures that will be required to conduct this experiment, and what the challenges will be
STIMULI & PROCEDURE:
In this experiment, participants will have two images flashed on the monitor in quick succession (face prime and the target object). They will be asked to ignore the first image and then try to quickly and accurately categorize the second image (the target object) as a gun or a toy by pressing one of two response keys (key assignments will be counterbalanced across participants).
The primes will be 12 photos of boys (6 Black, 6 White). The target objects will be 6 gun images taken from Payne (2001) and 6 toy images (e.g., a rattle) taken from online sources. 
Each trial sequence will begin with a blank screen (500 ms), followed by a face prime (200 ms), then a target object (200 ms), and finally a pattern mask (which remained on screen until participants responded). If participants did not respond within 500 ms, a message (“Please respond faster!”) will appear for 1 s. Each of the 12 face primes will be paired once with each of the 12 target objects, which resulted in 144 randomly ordered experi- mental trials. Eight practice trials will preceded the experimental trials.
After completing the weapon identification task, participants will rate the age and race-ethnicity of the face in each photo as well as how threatening the face seemed. 

CHALLENGES:
I think the biggest challenge here will be setting up the reaction time stuff and figuring out how to configure the response keys.
